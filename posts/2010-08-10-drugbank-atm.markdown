This post is about the [DrugBank ATM](/exhibits/approved_drugs.html).  Take a look there first to make sense of what follows....

For a few months, before this blog was launched, this URL quietly hosted an [Exhibit](http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Exhibit) of all the approved drugs annotated in the [DrugBank](http://www.drugbank.ca/) database.  DrugBank is a fantastic resource for carefully curated drug information, but browsing data through its web interface can sometimes be less than satisfying.  I've now brought this back as the [DrugBank ATM](/exhibits/approved_drugs.html).

Exhibit is an early semantic web tool that enabled fast client-side faceted searching using a JavaScript library called [Simile](http://code.google.com/p/simile-widgets/source/browse/), created by the good people at [CSAIL](http://www.csail.mit.edu/).  (The [timeline](http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/) presentation in the [author](http://www.pharmash.com/author.html) page is made using a widget from the Simile library.)  The same people who created Exhibit are now working on [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/), a community-driven repository to collect, annotate and publish structured data.

The DrugBank ATM only contains a tiny subset of the data that is collected in each drugcard entry.  I've created facets for the fields that are often the most difficult to sensibly browse, including `Therapeutic Category` and `Therapeutic Target`.  Since Exhibit is entirely client-driven, the entire dataset is dumped into the browser up-front.  Because of this, there is a practical limit to the size of the dataset to be explored.  Unfortunately, the entire DrugBank dataset is considerably above this practical limit. 

The images were generated by the [NCI Chemical Resolver](http://cactus.nci.nih.gov/chemical/structure).  Initially, these were live links to the resolver, but about 10% of the requests failed and response time was slow.  Consequently, they are now hosted statically on [Pharmash](http://www.pharmash.com).  It would be great to make these dynamically rendered chemical structures someday.

I'm happy to share the gritty details if anyone's interested.  Otherwise, enjoy the DrugBank ATM.
