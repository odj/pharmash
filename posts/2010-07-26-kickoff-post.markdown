I'm starting this blog as a platform to explore ideas around the future of the
pharmaceutical industry and how it might be shaped (hopefully for the better)
by rapid changes in social web technologies.  The industry as we have known
it for the last 20+ years cannot continue to sustain itself.  At the same
time, it will never cease to be a necessary and economically efficient
component of our overall healthcare system.  I am optimistic about its
future, and don't believe it will wither away the way the aerospace industry
did several decades ago.  Change will not come easily, but it will come with
substantial opportunity for those that embrace it at the right time.

I expect this blog will also have a heavy technical component to it, which at
times might have almost nothing to do with pharma.  This is the 'mash'
part.

Pharmash is generated by [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), a Haskell
library for generating static web sites.  There will undoubtedly be many
upcoming posts about Haskell and some informatics tools I have brewing using
this elegant language.

I hope you find my ideas interesting, maybe even useful.  While this blog might
occasionally have implicitly commercial content, it will *NEVER* have
pay-per-click ads.

Enjoy!
