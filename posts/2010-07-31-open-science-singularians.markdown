##Singularians and the Open Science Summit

Lots of Singularians (or at least representatives from [Singularity
University](http://singularityu.org/) )at the [Open Science
Summit](http://opensciencesummit.com/).  I think I understand why.  If their
goals are to:

*  Educate people about the singularity concept so that technologies that head 
in that direction don't scare them, and 
* Promote activities that might accelerate it's arrival,

...then they are probably in the right place.  I had never previously connected
open science with this group, but it makes sense for them to be there.

If you're a Singularian, please leave a comment and let me know if any of the speculations above
are even close.
