##Open Science

There are far too many topics from this [fascinating
conference](http://opensciencesummit.com/) for me to cover in a single
comprehensible post.  As a general theme, this is a group of people who has
realized that the philosophy of science and the nature of innovation has
fundamentally changed in the digital age, and we need to navigate our way
through this change.

As a lodestar for this process, scientists are looking at the apparent success
of the open source movement in the software field.  Parallels here abound,
particularly when biological science research begins to resemble more of an
information science or an engineering discipline than it ever has before.  It
is an interesting exercise to lay out some of these parallels explicitly and
see where key difference currently exist, as well as where similarities
might exist in the future.

I am a complete believer in the positive role that open source has
and continues to play in software.  What is the analogous role for biological
research? 


##Free vs Open

One of my favorite expressions from the software community is *"Free as in
beer"*.  What this means is when someone gives you a free beer, you get exactly
that, a free beer.  You can drink it and will probably enjoy that.  But there
is little else you can do with it.  Software can be free as in beer, but the
meaning the community intends is free as in freedom.  Freedom to use it in
alternative ways.  Freedom to learn from the way it is implemented.  Freedom to
make it better.  

Software can be easily set free because the information content of it is
essentially one and the same with its "objective" reality (this is the opposite of
beer, which has a very obvious objective reality, but not much in the way
of information content).  In the biological sciences, this distinction *does*
exist, and is somewhere between software and beer.  When these distinctions are
large, as they currently are for biology and medicine, they can present a
significant barrier to application of open innovation, and an even greater barrier to 
the hobbyist.

##The Relationship Between Information and Reality

The benefits of open collaboration are only possible if contributors can share
a common reality.  The ease at which this can be made to happen directly affects the
potential benefits of open collaborative work.  Software is unique in that information IS
its reality, and can be shared instantaneously and at nearly zero cost.
Consequently, it can very easily be set free.  The same cannot be said of the
biological sciences.  This is a well recognized problem, and is being attacked
head-on by organizations such as [Sage Bionetworks](http://sagebase.org/) and
others.  But it is not easy and does not come cheap. 

##Community Participation and the Role of Hobbyists

Lots of interesting stories from the [DIY Bio](http://diybio.org/) folks and
the growing role of hobbyists in biomedical research.  From a synthetic
biologist perspective: biology is a lot like a computer, now with PC like
availability.

The table below represents a common theme from the conference, exhibiting
analogous tools that convert information into something useful.  The vision is
that the *compilation* step will eventually be trivial across most
sub-disciplines of the life sciences, allowing the hobbyist to "hack" biology
with the same convenience and satisfaction of instant feedback (and security
concerns) with which people hack code today.

##Cost of Commercialization and IP

Here, there is another huge discrepancy.  In software, the cost to commercialize
a technology is usually an incremental amount over the cost to develop it in
the first place.  In medicine, the cost to commercialize a technology is 
disproportionately larger than the cost of the underlying discovery.  This
creates a condition where the choice of what to develop and who owns it is not
always driven by societal benefit and is almost never "fair".  Software has its
own IP woes, but they are nowhere near As dysfunctional as the role of IP in
pharmaceutical research and development seem to be.  There were a lot of creative solutions
to this problem presented, including impact based prizes, variants of government
sponsored monopolies and others, all meant to shape the economic landscape of
innovation to steer it in directions that are more efficient, provide greater
sociological benefit, or are open (preferably all three).  This is a huge challenge for which I see no end, but instead perpetual maneuvering.
